[DESCRIPTION]
This is the README for zon

This command line tool prints the time for the next sun rise or sun set in your location. It's targeted at integration with systemd or cron/at timers to give you activation relative to sun rise and sun set, rather than at a fixed time. This is accurate enough to be used for swithing on and off your garden lights, solar panels, security alarms etc. It can also give the suns actual position in the sky.

To produce human readable output you could convert the standard iso format output using the 'date' command, e.g. date -d $(zon -r), so your preferred timezone is used.

If you do not specify a location, the program will try to estimate it using the main location of your timezone according to /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone1970.tab. For best results you have to supply your location in latitude and longitude by supplying the parameter '-l' or an entry in ~/.config/zon.conf or /etc/zon.conf, see --help instructions below.

This program could be called from cron or a standard systemd timer to insert a delay (much like the program sunwait - find elsewhere - would). A systemd timer will require a systemd-run --on-calendar call as well. This method has limitations near the poles however (see below), which can be overcome by creating a "chain" of invocations of zon. See examples. 

Be careful when running this program in regions above 65 or below -65 degrees latitude. Day and nighttime can be very short or non existent, in which case daily execution of a sun wait delay will only result in multiple schedules for the same sun rise/set. Near the poles use the chain method.

Output is always in UTC, because that is convenient for scripting and unambigious for scheduling. Default output has an ISO time stamp format, eg 2021-02-28T01:00+00:00. For display purposes the regular date command can convert this to whatever desired timezone and formatting, e.g. by 'date -d <isotimestamp>'. See examples.

This program will give you the actual next rise and/or set time if your system-time is accurate enough. You may however specify any other reference date-time between 1/1/1900 and 31/12/2099, by supplying a time to zon's  '-d' parameter in ISO format. This could be used e.g. to show sun rise on new years day, or your birthday next year, etc. The required ISO formatted time can be generated with the 'date -Im' command. See examples. For convenience the program will invoke this date command for you, if you specify "date today + 2 days" (e.g.) for de -d switch (for syntax, see man page for date).

With the '-@' parameter output is usable for scheduling with the 'at' command, but make sure you set the TZ environemnt variable to utc before invoking the at command. For example: echo myjob.sh | TZ=utc at `zon -r@' will run your job at the next sun rise (display the resulting schedule with the 'TZ=utc atq' command). You should not rely on the "utc" directive of the at command, because it is not always observed (at least, that is what the author has found).

With the '-y' parameter the output is usable for ad hoc/transient scheduling with the 'systemd-run' command, because it will contain the "UTC" timezone indicator. Be reminded that systemd-run --on-calendar is a recent addition and may not work for you.
 
The '-v' option will add a descriptive label. A second or third repeat of this option will print some more or less usefull extra data as well.

Please note: It would be straightforward to include the current local timezone in the output, however i.m.o. this makes no sense because the timezone is subject to future daylight saving time changes rendering the printed time unreliable for scheduling. The 'date' command will handle the changing timezones correctly if required.

[EXAMPLES]
Example to schedule a job at sun rise with the at command:
export risetime=$(zon -r@) ; 
echo myscheduledjob.sh | TZ=UTC at $risetime ; 
echo "The job is scheduled for UTC $risetime"

export risetime=$(zon -r)
echo myscheduledjob.sh | TZ=UTC at $(date -d $risetime "+%H:%M %Y-%m-%d")  ; 
echo "The job is scheduled for local time $(date -d $risetime) 

Example for systemd-run command:
export risetime=$(zon -ry);
systemd-run --on-calendar="$risetime" myscheduledjob.sh;
echo "The job is scheduled for $risetime"

systemd-run --on-calendar="$(zon --rise --systemd)" touch /tmp/sunrise.time

systemd-run --on-calendar="$(zon -ry)" touch /tmp/sunrise.time

Example to give sunrise time somewhere else in a certain timezone, on a future date after DST switch:
zon$ TZ=CET date -d $( zon -rd $(date -Im -d "now + 5 month") -l +490800+1851356 );

HOW TO BUILD: 
This requires the 'autotools' toolchain. With this prequisite fulfilled you can build from source tar-ball with:
mkdir workdir ;
tar -xvf source-ball.tar
autoreconf --install # run this command only if ./configure complains about configure.in) ;
./configure ;
make ; 
make install ; 

[FILES]
/$HOME/.config/zon.conf 

/etc/zon.conf

first line should contain default latitude en longitude +DDMM[SS]+DDDMM[SS] exactly as below without spaces:
 
location=+501010+0113030 OR 
location=+5010+01130
